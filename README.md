# 🧠 AI Wallet Agents on Solana

Autonomous wallets that can think and act — safely, transparently, and on-chain.

🚀 Overview

AI Wallet Agents is a Solana-based prototype that allows wallets to perform autonomous on-chain actions — such as trading, staking, or DAO voting — based on predefined user rules and real-time data.

Instead of manually signing every transaction, users can set up intent-based policies, and the AI agent automatically executes actions within those rules.
The goal is to bring AI-driven automation to Web3 — without compromising user control or security.

🎯 Problem

Managing on-chain actions is manual, repetitive, and reactive.
DeFi users, DAO participants, and traders often need to:

Monitor market changes constantly,

Claim or rebalance assets manually,

Make time-sensitive decisions.

Off-chain bots exist, but they lack trust — users can’t verify what those bots are doing.
We need on-chain verifiable automation that blends the intelligence of AI with the trust of blockchain.

💡 Solution

AI Wallet Agents combine:

Off-chain AI logic (decision-making)

On-chain execution (Solana smart contract)

User-defined safety rules (wallet policy)

This creates a system where:

AI decides ✅ → Wallet verifies ✅ → Solana executes ⚡

No action happens outside the user’s control, and every transaction is fully transparent and verifiable.

🧩 System Architecture
User → AI Agent (off-chain logic)
      → Policy Rules (user intent)
      → Solana Program (on-chain verification)
      → Transaction Execution
      → On-chain Audit Log

Layer	Role	Example Tools
AI Logic (off-chain)	Observes data & decides when to act	Python, OpenAI API
Oracle Data	Feeds real-time asset prices	Pyth / Switchboard
Wallet Contract	Enforces policy before executing	Solana + Anchor
Blockchain Interface	Sends signed transactions	solana-py / solana-web3.js
Audit Layer	Logs “executed by AI under rule X”	On-chain logs

⚙️ Tech Stack (Might change)
Component	Technology
Blockchain	Solana Devnet
Smart Contract Framework	Anchor (Rust)
Off-chain Agent	Python (AI logic + solana-py SDK)
Price Feed	Pyth Network Oracle
Frontend (optional)	React.js or HTML Dashboard
IDE	VS Code / Anchor CLI
🔧 How It Works

Define a Rule:
Example — “If SOL < $130, buy 1 SOL.”

AI Monitors Market:
The off-chain Python agent checks real-time SOL/USDC price via Pyth API.

Trigger Detected:
Once the condition matches, AI prepares a signed transaction.

Wallet Verifies:
The on-chain smart contract ensures:

The AI is authorized

The rule matches the allowed policy

Execute & Log:
Transaction executes on Solana devnet and logs:

Executed by AI agent under rule: SOL < 130 at block #XXXX

🔐 Security & Trust Layers

✅ Threshold Signatures: AI + user co-sign important actions
✅ Policy Enforcement: Wallet only allows actions inside predefined rules
✅ On-chain Audit Log: Every AI decision is transparently recorded
✅ No Private Key Sharing: AI never holds or accesses the full wallet key

Future additions:

Zero-Knowledge Proofs (to prove AI followed rules privately)

Multi-Agent Coordination (DAO or fund-level automation)

🧪 Quick Start
1️⃣ Clone Repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-wallet-agent-solana.git
cd ai-wallet-agent-solana

2️⃣ Setup Solana Environment
solana-install init
solana config set --url https://api.devnet.solana.com
solana-keygen new

3️⃣ Run Local Validator (optional)
solana-test-validator

4️⃣ Build Anchor Program
anchor build
anchor deploy

5️⃣ Run AI Agent Script
python ai_agent.py


✅ Output:

[AI Agent] Monitoring SOL price...
[Trigger Hit] SOL < 130 → Executing transaction
[Transaction Sent] Signature: 5XY8u2D...


Then view the transaction on Solana Explorer

🌍 Why Solana?

Solana’s speed, parallelism, and low fees make it the only chain practical for real-time AI agents.

Sub-second block time

Near-zero gas fees

Parallel transaction processing

Local fee markets prevent congestion

These features make AI-driven automation not just possible — but affordable and scalable.
